## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Diego Guerrero, a BSc. Technology student at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). My passion for
physics, mathematics and computing has been the driving force behind my academic journey. My interests
mainly focuses on problems that can be solved via high performance computing, such as optimization problems
and the simulation or control of quantum and classical mechanical systems. Currently, I am a research intern at
the Institute of Nuclear Sciences (ICN - UNAM) in the Structure of Matter Department, where I develop
quantum computing algorithms.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a quantum perceptron algorithm to classify photons and identify light sources using quantum machine learning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced concepts in quantum mechanics, quantum computing, and high-performance computing for optimization and simulation problems.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects involving quantum algorithms, quantum machine learning, and classical or quantum mechanical system simulations.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with complex control system design, quantum computing frameworks, and machine learning models for physical systems.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about quantum algorithms, quantum perceptrons, quantum field theory, and mechatronic systems design.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy bridging the gap between classical mechanics and quantum computing by designing robotic systems with a quantum twist
